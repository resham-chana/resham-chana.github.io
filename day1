      <p>My first entry</p>
      <p>To be honest, I am not entirely sure that coding is for me. I don’t see many people who look like me at my job. And I always feel like there is so much more to learn. I don’t know as much as google or chat GPT – does that mean I’m useless? So I’m going to go easy on myself. Just starting is good enough for me. Who knows if it’ll be good enough for employers. But I’ve made this website – using some simple HTML and CSS. And I’ll be trying to update this with things I’m learning about. Today it was methods and functions in Python to create some cute summary statistics. 
        Also above is how this website looked an hour ago. PROGRESS!

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Resh or Resham. I am a Data Scientist and Math Graduate. I like gymnastics, calisthenics, running and lifting heavy things. I have mad anxiety - but don't we all. And I have imposter syndrome. This website is just for me to help realise the little things add up and to have a place to store all the things I've learnt. Enjoy!</p>
